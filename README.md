# Process Scheduler
by: Andrew Tenhagen

This project was created for the Summer 2017 Operating Systems course (comp 3475-01). It uses basic java with no gui implimentation to schedule processes. The system runs in the command line, so it can be run on any system with a JRE. The algorithms that work are:

  - First Come First Serve
  - Shortest Job First
  - Shortest Remaining Job
  - Priority
  - Round Robin Fixed Quantum
  - Round Robin Variable Quantum

# Features!

<br />Added delay to the output of the ghant chart
<br />Added rerun option
<br />Added error checking on integer inputs
